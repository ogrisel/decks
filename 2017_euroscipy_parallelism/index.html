## Python GIL

.normal[
The internal implementation of python interpreter relies on a
"Global Interpreter Lock" **(GIL)**, protecting the concurrent access to
python objects:

- Only one thread can acquire it.

- Not designed for efficient multicore computing.

**Global lock everytime we access a python object.**

Released when performing long I/O operations or by some libraries.

# Sharing objects between workers

.normal2[
As processes use separate interpreters, `ProcessPoolExecutor` needs communication
chanels to exchange python objects between processes.

In `Thread` this is not an issue as the interpreter is shared.

Use `pickle` to serialize the different objects in pipes or sockets.

This is abstracted in the `multiprocessing.Queue`.

exclude: true
# Starting a new interpreter

In `multiprocessing`, you can use `set_start_method` to use different implementations
of `Process`:

* `fork`: Fast start, clone the interpreter state.
* `spawn`: Slow start, need to reload libraries
* `forkserver`: Faster start but harder to use properly.

Issue with `fork`: cloning the interpreter also clone the objects that point to the other Thread.

???

`forkserver` is faster as you can preload libraries in the server process and those libraries
will be available in the child processes.

# Conclusion

# Conclusion

.normal3[

- `Thread` can be efficient to run multicore programs if your code releases the **GIL**.

- Else, you should use `Process` with `spawn` and try to reuse the pool of process as much as possible.

- `loky` can help you do that ;).

- Improves the management of a pool of workers in projects such as `joblib`.
